- 🌐 Real-time progress dashboard deployed to website

## 📈 Strategic Analysis
### Progress Velocity
- **Current Velocity**: 0.0 TODOs resolved per week
- **Status**: ⚠️ **CRITICAL** - Progress velocity below target
- **Trend Analysis**: Stable tracking but resolution rate needs improvement

### Priority Distribution Analysis
- **CRITICAL (21.1%)**: 121 items - Core research gaps and validation needs
- **HIGH (20.2%)**: 116 items - Experimental infrastructure requirements  
- **MEDIUM (36.8%)**: 211 items - Implementation and methodology details
- **EXTERNAL (19.7%)**: 113 items - Expert reviews and validations

### Risk Assessment Matrix
#### 🔴 High Risk Items
1. **Mock Data Proliferation**: Multiple chapters contain placeholder results
2. **Validation Infrastructure**: Missing experimental evaluation pipelines
3. **Literature Currency**: Need 15-20 recent citations (2022-2024)

#### 🟡 Medium Risk Items
1. **TODO Resolution Velocity**: Current pace insufficient for timeline
2. **Content Depth**: Word count below thesis requirements
3. **Baseline Implementation**: Comparative methods not yet implemented

#### 🟢 Low Risk Items
1. **Build System**: LaTeX compilation robust and automated
2. **Progress Tracking**: Comprehensive monitoring system operational
3. **Quality Framework**: Automated checks and validation in place

## 🎯 Strategic Objectives for Next Month
### Immediate Priorities (Week 1-2)
1. **Validation Infrastructure Setup**
   - Implement experimental evaluation pipeline
   - Set up baseline comparison methods
   - Create reproducible experiment framework

2. **Critical TODO Resolution**
   - Target: Reduce critical TODOs from 121 to <80
   - Focus on empirical validation requirements
   - Address mock data replacement in Part II & IV

### Medium-term Goals (Week 3-4)
3. **Literature Review Enhancement**
   - Add 15-20 recent citations (2022-2024)
   - Update agent observability and distributed tracing sections
   - Strengthen theoretical foundations

4. **Content Development**
   - Expand word count by 15,000-20,000 words
   - Complete methodology sections for Parts II-VI
   - Draft initial results chapters

## 📋 Action Plan & Milestones
### Week 1 Targets
